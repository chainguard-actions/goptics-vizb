## Findings Fixed

### script-injection (severity: high)

Multiple run: blocks in action.yml directly interpolate ${{ ... }} expressions inside shell commands, violating rule (a). This allows an attacker who controls any of the listed inputs to inject arbitrary shell commands.

1. 'Resolve vizb version' step: `if [ -n "${{ inputs.vizb-binary }}" ]` and `REF="${{ github.action_ref }}"` — both interpolated directly in the shell script.

2. 'Install vizb' step: `VIZB_BINARY="${{ inputs.vizb-binary }}"`, `OS=$(echo "${{ runner.os }}" | ...)`, `ARCH=$(echo "${{ runner.arch }}" | ...)`, `TAG="${{ steps.version.outputs.tag }}"` — all directly interpolated.

3. 'Resolve input' step: `FILE="${{ inputs.file }}"`, `FILE="${{ inputs.bench-file }}"`, `CMD="${{ inputs.cmd }}"`, `CMD="${{ inputs.bench-cmd }}"`, plus `${{ inputs.merge-files }}`, `${{ inputs.merge-dir }}`, `${{ inputs.data-url }}`, `${{ inputs.output-json }}` — all directly interpolated.

4. 'Convert to JSON' step: Dozens of direct interpolations including `${{ inputs.tag }}`, `${{ inputs.id }}`, `${{ inputs.name }}`, `${{ inputs.title }}`, `${{ inputs.description }}`, `${{ inputs.group }}`, `${{ inputs.group-pattern }}`, `${{ inputs.group-regex }}`, `${{ inputs.sort }}`, `${{ inputs.filter }}`, `${{ inputs.mem-unit }}`, `${{ inputs.time-unit }}`, `${{ inputs.number-unit }}`, `${{ inputs.round }}`, `${{ inputs.col-axis }}`, `${{ inputs.json-path }}`, `${{ inputs.show-labels }}`, `${{ inputs.parser }}`, `${{ inputs.charts }}`, `${{ inputs.chart }}`, `${{ inputs.stat }}`, `${{ steps.resolve.outputs.file }}`, `${{ steps.resolve.outputs.json_file }}`. Critically, `${{ steps.resolve.outputs.cmd }}` is executed directly as a shell command: `${{ steps.resolve.outputs.cmd }} > "$INPUT"` — this is arbitrary command execution from user-controlled input.

5. 'Merge' step: `${{ steps.resolve.outputs.json_file }}`, `${{ inputs.merge-files }}` (unquoted array expansion), `${{ inputs.merge-dir }}`, `${{ inputs.tag-axis }}`.

6. 'Generate HTML' step: `${{ inputs.charts }}`, `${{ inputs.chart }}`, `${{ inputs.stat }}`, `${{ inputs.enable-3d }}`, `${{ inputs.data-url }}`, `${{ inputs.output-html }}`, `${{ steps.resolve.outputs.json_file }}`.

### github-env-injection (severity: high)

Multiple run: blocks write values derived from untrusted inputs to $GITHUB_OUTPUT and $GITHUB_PATH without the required sanitization step (printf '%s' ... | tr -d '\n\r').

1. 'Resolve vizb version' step: `REF` is set from `${{ github.action_ref }}` and then written unsanitized: `echo "tag=$REF" >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"` and `echo "tag=$TAG" >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"` (where $TAG is derived from $REF). An attacker controlling the action ref could inject newlines to set arbitrary GITHUB_OUTPUT variables.

2. 'Resolve input' step: `FILE` is set from `${{ inputs.file }}`/`${{ inputs.bench-file }}` and `CMD` from `${{ inputs.cmd }}`/`${{ inputs.bench-cmd }}`. These are written to $GITHUB_OUTPUT via: `echo "$FILE"` and `echo "$CMD"` inside a heredoc block. Additionally, `OUT_JSON` from `${{ inputs.output-json }}` is written as `echo "json_file=$OUT_JSON" >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"` without sanitization.

3. 'Install vizb' step: `echo "$HOME/.local/bin" >> "$GITHUB_PATH"` — while $HOME is not user-controlled, the pattern of writing to $GITHUB_PATH without sanitization is present throughout.

### unpinned-uses (severity: high)

The action uses `actions/cache@v6` which is pinned to a mutable version tag rather than an immutable 40-character commit SHA. This means the action could be silently updated to a malicious version without any change to this file. It should be pinned to a full SHA, e.g. `actions/cache@5a3ec84eff668545956fd18022155c47e93e2684 # v4`.

## Iteration Notes

### Iteration 1

**Fixes applied:** script-injection, static-inline-injection, github-env-injection, unpinned-uses

**Notes:**

Fixed all findings in hardened/action/action.yml:

1. **script-injection / static-inline-injection**: Moved all ${{ }} expressions from run: blocks into env: blocks for all 6 steps. The most critical fix was the 'Convert to JSON' step where `${{ steps.resolve.outputs.cmd }}` was being executed directly as a shell command — it is now passed via RESOLVE_CMD env var and tokenized safely with xargs into a bash array before execution.

2. **github-env-injection**: All writes to $GITHUB_OUTPUT now sanitize values with `printf '%s' "$VAR" | tr -d '\n\r'` before writing. The file/cmd outputs use sanitized printf in the heredoc block. The tag/ref outputs in 'Resolve vizb version' are sanitized. The json_file output is sanitized.

3. **unpinned-uses**: Pinned `actions/cache@v6` to `actions/cache@55cc8345863c7cc4c66a329aec7e433d2d1c52a9 # v6`.

4. **merge-files handling**: The `inputs.merge-files` space-separated list is now properly tokenized with xargs into a bash array to preserve argument boundaries, replacing the unsafe unquoted `${{ inputs.merge-files }}` expansion.

### Iteration 2

**Fixes applied:** unpinned-uses

**Notes:**

Pinned both unpinned action references in hardened/action/.github/actions/setup-js/action.yml:
- pnpm/action-setup@v6 → pnpm/action-setup@0977fd99725f1db4007ccb2928dbb4e90d06cc86 # v6
- actions/setup-node@v6 → actions/setup-node@249970729cb0ef3589644e2896645e5dc5ba9c38 # v6
Original tag names preserved as inline comments for readability.
