Action **goptics--vizb/v0.18.0** was hardened automatically. 63 finding(s) were identified and resolved across 1 iteration(s).

## Findings Fixed

### script-injection (severity: high)

Multiple `${{ }}` expressions are directly interpolated inside `run:` shell blocks throughout action.yml, violating rule (a). This includes attacker-controlled inputs and step outputs:

**'Resolve vizb version' step (~line 126):** `if [ -n "${{ inputs.vizb-binary }}" ]` and `REF="${{ github.action_ref }}"` — expressions interpolated directly into shell.

**'Install vizb' step (~line 163):** `VIZB_BINARY="${{ inputs.vizb-binary }}"`, `OS=$(echo "${{ runner.os }}" | tr ...)`, `ARCH=$(echo "${{ runner.arch }}" | tr ...)`, `TAG="${{ steps.version.outputs.tag }}"` — all directly interpolated.

**'Resolve input' step (~line 175):** `FILE="${{ inputs.file }}"`, `FILE="${{ inputs.bench-file }}"`, `CMD="${{ inputs.cmd }}"`, `CMD="${{ inputs.bench-cmd }}"`, `${{ inputs.merge-files }}`, `${{ inputs.merge-dir }}`, `${{ inputs.data-url }}`, `OUT_JSON="${{ inputs.output-json }}"` — all directly interpolated.

**'Convert to JSON' step (~line 205):** Dozens of `${{ inputs.* }}` expressions directly in run block, plus the critically dangerous `${{ steps.resolve.outputs.cmd }} > "$INPUT"` which executes user-controlled input as a shell command.

**'Merge' step (~line 248):** `JSON_FILE="${{ steps.resolve.outputs.json_file }}"`, `FILES+=(${{ inputs.merge-files }})` (unquoted!), `FILES+=("${{ inputs.merge-dir }}")`, `--tag-axis "${{ inputs.tag-axis }}"`.

**'Generate HTML' step (~line 260):** `${{ inputs.charts }}`, `${{ inputs.chart }}`, `${{ inputs.stat }}`, `${{ inputs.enable-3d }}`, `${{ inputs.data-url }}`, `${{ inputs.output-html }}`, `${{ steps.resolve.outputs.json_file }}`.

All `${{ ... }}` expressions inside `run:` blocks should be moved to `env:` variables and then referenced as quoted shell variables.

### github-env-injection (severity: high)

Several `run:` blocks write values derived from untrusted inputs to `$GITHUB_OUTPUT` without the required sanitization step (`printf '%s' ... | tr -d '\n\r'`):

**'Resolve vizb version' step:** `echo "tag=$REF" >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"` and `echo "tag=$TAG" >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"` — `$REF` is set from `${{ github.action_ref }}` without sanitization before the write.

**'Resolve input' step:** The block writes `$FILE` (derived from `${{ inputs.file }}` / `${{ inputs.bench-file }}`) and `$CMD` (derived from `${{ inputs.cmd }}` / `${{ inputs.bench-cmd }}`) to `$GITHUB_OUTPUT` using `echo "$FILE"` and `echo "$CMD"` inside a heredoc-style multiline write. It also writes `echo "json_file=$OUT_JSON" >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"` where `$OUT_JSON` comes from `${{ inputs.output-json }}`. None of these writes are preceded by `printf '%s' ... | tr -d '\n\r'` sanitization, allowing newline injection into the output file.

### unpinned-uses (severity: high)

The following `uses:` references are pinned to mutable version tags rather than immutable 40-character commit SHAs, making them vulnerable to supply-chain attacks if the tag is moved:

- `actions/cache@v6` (action.yml, 'Cache vizb binary' step)
- `pnpm/action-setup@v6` (.github/actions/setup-js/action.yml)
- `actions/setup-node@v6` (.github/actions/setup-js/action.yml)

All should be pinned to full SHA digests, e.g. `actions/cache@<40-char-sha> # v6`.

## Iteration Notes

### Iteration 1

**Fixes applied:** script-injection, static-inline-injection, github-env-injection, unpinned-uses

**Notes:**

Fixed all findings in action.yml and .github/actions/setup-js/action.yml:

1. **unpinned-uses**: Pinned actions/cache@v6→SHA 55cc8345, pnpm/action-setup@v6→SHA 0977fd99, actions/setup-node@v6→SHA 24997072.

2. **script-injection / static-inline-injection**: Moved ALL ${{ }} expressions out of run: blocks into env: blocks for all 5 steps (Resolve vizb version, Install vizb, Resolve input, Convert to JSON, Merge, Generate HTML). Shell scripts now reference only plain $ENV_VAR variables.

3. **github-env-injection**: Added `printf '%s' "$VAR" | tr -d '\n\r'` sanitization before all GITHUB_OUTPUT writes that use user-controlled values (tag, file, cmd, json_file outputs).

4. **Dangerous cmd execution**: Replaced the critically dangerous `${{ steps.resolve.outputs.cmd }} > "$INPUT"` pattern (which executed user input as a shell command) with safe xargs-based tokenization into an array, then `"${cmd_args[@]}" > "$INPUT"`.

5. **merge-files unquoted expansion**: Replaced `FILES+=(${{ inputs.merge-files }})` with a guarded xargs tokenization loop that properly handles quoted filenames.
